This is a modern cache implementation, inspired by the following papers, provides high efficiency.

- SIEVE | [SIEVE is Simpler than LRU: an Efficient Turn-Key Eviction Algorithm for Web Caches (NSDI'24)](https://junchengyang.com/publication/nsdi24-SIEVE.pdf)
- S3-FIFO | [FIFO queues are all you need for cache eviction (SOSP'23)]((https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600006.3613147))
- W-TinyLFU | [TinyLFU: A Highly Efficient Cache Admission Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00727)

This offers state-of-the-art efficiency and scalability compared to other LRU-based cache algorithms.
